```
git clone https://github.com/roessler-f/DNAQuantification
```

2. Download and install the image processing software **Fiji** to run the macro script *contrastEnhancementAndScale.ijm*. You can download the software and find installation instructions using this [link](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/).

3. Python

4. Download and install **MATLAB** to run the script *measureDNALength.m*. You can get MATLAB using this [link](https://se.mathworks.com/products/get-matlab.html). Additionally to the basic version of MATLAB, you need the **[Image Processing Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/help/images/getting-started-with-image-processing-toolbox.html)** to run the script.
